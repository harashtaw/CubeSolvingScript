# CubeSolvingScript

Using nicpatel963's openCV python program to detect the state of 3x3 Rubiks Cube
Convert the generated algorithm to a light guidance using an Arduino and an LED 8x8 Matrix 

It's not pretty but it works notheless
LED is just a placeholder for servo/stepper motor command in the next iteration wich is a rubik's solving robot
